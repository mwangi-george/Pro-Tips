# encrypting data

```{r}

# The first step for the encryptr workflow is to create a pair of encryption keys. This uses the openssl package. 
# The public key is used to encrypt information and can be shared. The private key allows decryption of the encrypted information. 
# It requires a password to be set. This password cannot be recovered if lost. If the file is lost or overwritten, any data encrypted with the public key cannot be decrypted.

genkeys()

# encrypt and decrypt
diamonds %>%
  head() %>% 
  encrypt(price, clarity) %>% 
  decrypt(price, clarity)
```
